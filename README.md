# Pop-up Preventive Care in Florida

This project analyzes CDC healthcare data found at https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Place-Data-GIS-Friendly-Format-2022-release/vgc8-iyc4 to propose pop up health care as an accessible solution to lack of access to preventive healthcare in Florida. 

Group members utilized python, pandas, and jupyter notebook to clean the dataset and reduce down to state state data where needed. Tableau visualization software was used to create multiple visualizations and dashboards as part of the exploratory analysis. Finally, the data and research were presented on a website, accessed through the index.html file.
